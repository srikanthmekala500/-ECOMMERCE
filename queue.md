## What is Queue Data Structure?
Queue Data Structure is a linear data structure that is open at both ends and the operations are performed in First In First Out (FIFO) order.

We define a queue to be a list in which all additions to the list are made at one end (back of the queue), and all deletions from the list are made at the other end(front of the queue).  The element which is first pushed into the order, the delete operation is first performed on that.

## Real-Life Queue in Data Structure Example
Letâ€™s consider a queue in data structure example. A line of people is waiting to buy a ticket at a cinema hall. A new person will join the line from the end, and the person standing at the front will be the first to get the ticket and leave the line. Similarly, in a queue data structure, data added will leave the queue first.

## Some other applications of the queue in real life are:
* People on an escalator
* Cashier line in a store
* A car wash line
* One way exits
## Basic Queue Operations in Queue Data Structure
## Operation 	   ## Description 
* enqueue() 	   Process of adding or storing an element to the end of the queue
* dequeue()	     Process of removing or accessing an element from the front of the queue 
* peek()        Used to get the element at the front of the queue without removing it
* initialize()	Creates an empty queue
* isfull()	    Checks if the queue is full
* isempty()	   Check if the queue is empty
